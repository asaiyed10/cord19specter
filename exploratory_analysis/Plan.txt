Direction 1: 

Goal: Ltierature Clustering 
-----------------------
Why: Identify trends in research within CORD-19 dataset

Methods: 
-------------------
1. CORD-19 Embedding 
    produced form SPECTER

2. PCA 
    N_compents that give explain 90% of underlying variation 

3. K-Mmeans
    Pass PCA compnents into K-means for cluster labeling 
    Determine K-Clusters by Silhoutte score

4. Visualization: 
    TSNE or UMAP on sample with Cluster assignments from K-MEANS
    


Direction 2: 

Goal: Colloboration Graph
-----------------------------
Why: What are the shortest distances between colloborators? 

Methods: 

author|author| source_paper| source_journal 

1. Create Co-authors graph 

2. BFS vs DFS search for Shortest-PAth between two authors 



Direction 3: 

Goal: Community Detection on Citation Graph 
--------------------------------
1. Preprocess citations from documents into edges 

author | citation | source_paper | cited_paper | source_journal| cited_journal|

Direction 4: 

Goal: Text Analysis describing clusters or communities 

Can we label each cluster or community?
